  # What makes this unique

  This was my first commercial project, so I hold it in high regard. Additionally, I had the opportunity to share my knowledge with a colleague during the site development process, which brings me satisfaction, as contributing to the knowledge of others enriches my soul.

  Furthermore, I seized the chance to learn the basics of SEO in order to enhance the site's visibility, nurturing my passion for continuous learning.

      # Why these technologies

      As mentioned earlier, this project was developed with the support of a colleague to whom I could share basic knowledge in web development. For this reason, I considered it prudent to choose a basic technological stack, yet following best practices to, even given the circumstances, deliver a professional product.

  # Things that made it worth it

  The fact that it is my first commercial project filled me with enthusiasm, as it represented the first economic reward for doing what I am passionate about, something that, with a lot of effort, I have managed to learn. This motivates me to continue on this path, thereby gaining confidence in my knowledge.
