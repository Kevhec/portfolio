  # What makes this unique

  This project was born out of the need to manage my mother's finances and help her become more conscious of her spending. Initially, I looked for an existing app that met my requirements but found that most were either paid or required a premium subscription to access the features I needed. This led me to the decision to build my own, tailored specifically to my needs while also challenging my development skills. And so, the project began.

      # Why these technologies

      To achieve my desired functionalities, I knew I had to implement both the backend and the frontend. Therefore, I chose familiar tools like **Node.js** and **Express.js** as the foundation for the backend and **React** for the frontend.
      <br/>
      Focusing on the frontend, given its dashboard nature, I opted for **React**â€”not only for its suitability but also as an opportunity to enhance my skills. I implemented a robust state management system using the **Context API** and the `useReducer` hook, creating modular actions for each context. For routing, I selected **React Router** due to its powerful capabilities and simple API, which allowed me to define clear paths and maintain modular, DRY-friendly code. For the UI, I leveraged the **Shadcn** component system, which impressed me with its high degree of customization and control, especially when handling form submissions and validations with its compatibility with `zod` and `react-hook-form`.
      <br/>
      Given that my experience with backend development was limited, I considered **Express.js** a good option to begin my learning journey. I leveraged its built-in router for handling routing and took advantage of its middleware-based system. Specifically, I used middlewares for tasks such as verifying *authentication*, validating data with **zod**, and controlling access to resources for database operations.
      <br/>
      For my database, I chose **Postgres SQL** due to its high popularity and diverse range of data types, and I used **Sequelize ORM** to simplify database operations with its comprehensive set of APIs. Additionally, I implemented a cron-based system using **node-cron** for managing subscription-based transactions and budgets, and I adopted the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern for my codebase.

  # Things that made it worth it

  The purpose behind this project made it truly worthwhile. My mother struggles with her finances and asked for my help. I wanted her to have the best app available, but the essential features were locked behind a paywall. Instead of settling for those limitations, I decided to create my own solution. This project wasn't just an excuse to practice or improve as a developer, it was a way to support my loved ones.
