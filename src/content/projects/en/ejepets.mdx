  # What makes this unique

  The objective was to create a tool for my city that enables people to discover businesses dedicated to enhancing the well being of their best friends. The seed of this idea sprouted when I envisioned the concern of my pet falling ill, and the potential to find a nearby establishment for immediate attention. Therefore, EjePets aims to gather all local businesses offering essential pet services within easy reach, ensuring convenience for pet owners.

    # Why these technologies

    Given its robustness and ability to optimize web applications, Next.js allowed for the optimal management of site routing, creating a protected route for the admin panel, and providing optimized resources based on the user's device. Furthermore, thanks to the use of React's hooks, it was possible to handle map interactions efficiently, applying real-time filters to locate establishments that offer precisely what is needed.

  # Things that made it worth it

  Given the project's characteristics, I managed to practice better handling of external APIs, the use of non-relational databases like Firestore, and form management to add new establishments, connecting the data with Firebase.

  While this represents a technical advancement, my favorite part is reaching out to the establishments to introduce them to the project and request permission to add them to the map. Successfully conveying the site's purpose, receiving beautiful images firsthand from these establishments, and putting my communication skills into practice with others were enriching experiences.
